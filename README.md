# OPM Generator

This repo contains some of the code (I could not include all) in order to generate many training examples for a Deep Learning project I am working on for Carbon Storage (https://github.com/willematack/CarbonStorage).

The code is adapted to work on high-performance compute clusters and utilizes parallelization to generate as mamy examples as possible.
